            <h2>1. Difference between `authorization` and `authentication`</h2>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p>Authentication verifies who the user is.Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.Example: By verifying their identity, employees can gain access to an HR application that includes their personal pay information, vacation time, and 401K data.</p>
            <h3>authorization</h3>
            <p>Authorization determines what resources a user can access.Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.Authorization always takes place after authentication.Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.Example: Once their level of access is authorized, employees and HR managers can access different levels of data based on the permissions set by the organization.</p>
